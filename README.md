WRITE-SAFE Writing Identifiability Tracking & Educational Fingerprint Evaluation
WRITE-SAFE is a local-first desktop tool designed to help users discover, understand, and manage the stylistic fingerprints hidden in their writing. Instead of rewriting text automatically, the app illuminates authorship signals and offers educational guidance on how to reduce identifiability—while keeping your voice in control. 🧠 Educational first, privacy always Learn how stylometry works in practice using your own real texts Explore language and style patterns that can reveal authorship online Understand temporal style drift and what shapes your personal writing signature Get explainable, token-level insights into what makes your writing yours WRITE-SAFE aims to make advanced authorship analysis accessible to everyone—especially those writing in decentralized ecosystems who want to protect their linguistic identity without sacrificing self-expression.
Early-stage prototype
The main branch and the main.py file contain the implementation of an early-stage prototype of WRITE-SAFE, built using:

Dash for UI

Plotly for visual components

The prototype contains very early, incomplete implementations of core WRITE-SAFE ideas.
It was built to evaluate the feasibility of local, explainable stylometric analysis and efficient, on-device authorship model training.
