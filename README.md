# **WRITE-SAFE**  
## **Writing Identifiability Tracking & Educational Fingerprint Evaluation**

WRITE-SAFE is a **local-first desktop tool** designed to help users **discover, understand, and manage the stylistic fingerprints in their writing**.  
Instead of rewriting text automatically, the app **exposes authorship signals** and provides **educational guidance on reducing identifiability**, all while keeping your **voice fully in your control**.

## 🧠 **Educational first, privacy always**

- Learn how stylometry works in practice using your own real texts  
- Explore language and style patterns that can reveal authorship online  
- Understand temporal style drift and what shapes your personal writing signature  
- Get explainable, token-level insights into what makes your writing *yours*

WRITE-SAFE makes advanced authorship analysis **accessible and understandable for everyday users**—especially those writing in **decentralized online communities** who want to **protect linguistic identity without losing self-expression**.

# 🛠 **Early-stage Prototype**

The `main` branch and `main.py` file contain the implementation of a **very early research prototype** of WRITE-SAFE, built using:

- **Dash** for UI  
- **Plotly** for data visualization  

The prototype contains **very early, incomplete implementations** of core WRITE-SAFE ideas.  
It was created to evaluate the feasibility of:

- **Local, explainable stylometric analysis**
- **Efficient, on-device authorship model training**

This version serves as a **feasibility-testing proof-of-concept** for validating assumptions and identifying key technical challenges early.  
It is **not yet a full, production-ready application**.
